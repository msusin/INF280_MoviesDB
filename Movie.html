A conquistador in Mayan country searches for the tree of life to free his captive queen; a medical researcher, working with various trees, looks for a cure that will save his dying wife; a space traveler, traveling with an aged tree encapsulated within a bubble, moves toward a dying star that&#39;s wrapped in a nebula; he seeks eternity with his love.

A young man just out of the shower answers the door to a neighbor woman and explains that he&#39;s visiting, has had a bad week, including being mugged, and doesn&#39;t know where his pal, who lives there, is. The neighbor is chatty; she&#39;s a coroner. Two thugs arrive and, believing the visitor to be the guy who lives there, take him to see the boss with the dead son, who tells him to kill the son of his Mob rival. Mistaken identity? What connects the threads? Cops are watching.</td>
