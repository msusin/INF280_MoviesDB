After high school, Darren went to Harvard University to study film (both live-action and animation). He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, starring Sean Gullette, which went on to becoming a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky didn&#39;t make a feature film until five years later, in February 1996, where he began creating the concept for Pi (1998). After Darren&#39;s script for Pi (1998) received great reactions from friends, he began production. The film re-teamed Aronofsky with Gullette, who played the lead. This went on to further successes, such as Requiem for a Dream (2000) and, most recently, the American remake of the Japanese film series &quot;Kozure okami&quot; (1973) (aka &quot;Lone Wolf &amp; Cub&quot;).</td>

Lucy&#39;s mother is from Beijing, and her father is from Shanghai. Once relegated to &quot;ethnic&quot; parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady. Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the &quot;dark and sarcastic&quot; atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993), &quot;ER&quot; (1994), and &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman&#39;s ephemeral sitcom &quot;Pearl&quot; (1996).</td>

Born in June 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, the young Freeman attended Los Angeles Community College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!. Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer&#39;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#39;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets&#39; drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.</td>

Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18, 1963, in Oklahoma, and raised in Springfield, Missouri. He majored in journalism at University of Missouri, but left college two credits shy of graduating to move to California. Pitt&#39;s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary primetime sudser &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various TV series through the &#39;80s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma &amp; Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis&#39; Thelma.

Edward also has two younger siblings named James and Molly. From the age of 5 onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) has always been interested in acting. At the age of 8, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee&#39;s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen&#39;s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance would earn him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor. In 1999 came the critically acclaimed Fight Club (1999) and in 2000 came his directorial debut in Keeping the Faith (2000).</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Amazingly versatile stage &amp; screen actor with sandy colored hair, pale complexion and a somewhat nervous disposition. Has a reputation for playing mentally unbalanced characters on-screen, however that generalisation would not do justice to Walken&#39;s depth and breadth of performances. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University &amp; ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;. Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven&#39;s Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985).</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>Undoubtedly one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film, Steven Spielberg is perhaps Hollywood&#39;s best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin&#39; (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin&#39; also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duel (1971) (TV), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling&#39;s &quot;Rod Serling&#39;s Night Gallery&quot; (1969), &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969) and &quot;Columbo: Murder by the Book (#1.1)&quot; (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Stanley Kubrick was born in New York, and was considered intelligent despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick&#39;s father Jack (a physician) sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle Martin Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something to interest his son, Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result. Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films.  Jack Kubrick&#39;s decision to give his son a camera for his thirteenth birthday would be an even wiser move: Kubrick became an avid photographer, and would often make trips around New York taking photographs which he would develop in a friend&#39;s darkroom. After selling an unsolicited photograph to Look Magazine, Kubrick began to associate with their staff photographers, and at the age of seventeen was offered a job as an apprentice photographer. In the next few years, Kubrick had regular assignments for &quot;Look&quot;, and would become a voracious movie-goer. Together with friend Alexander Singer, Kubrick planned a move into film, and in 1950 sank his savings into making the documentary Day of the Fight (1951). This was followed by several short commissioned documentaries (Flying Padre: An RKO-Pathe Screenliner (1951), and (The Seafarers (1953), but by attracting investors and hustling chess games in Central Park, Kubrick was able to make Fear and Desire (1953) in California.</td>

His first job in movies was as a production assistant on the 1981 low-budget film, Hell Night (1981), starring Linda Blair. He spent the next six years working in the art department as a set dresser and in set construction while struggling to establish himself as a writer. His first produced writing credit (shared) was on the 1987 film, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), directed by Chuck Russell. Darabont is one of only six filmmakers in history with the unique distinction of having his first two feature films receive nominations for the Best Picture Academy Award: 1994&#39;s The Shawshank Redemption (1994) (with a total of seven nominations) and 1999&#39;s The Green Mile (1999) (four nominations).

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Spacey&#39;s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn (1986). Deemed more of a &quot;character actor&quot; than a &quot;leading man&quot;, he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain &quot;Mel Profitt&quot; on the TV series &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Swimming with Sharks (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects (1995). The &quot;Suspects&quot; role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher&#39;s thriller Se7en (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino&#39;s Looking for Richard (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Albino Alligator (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban satire American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences&#39; imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>A graduate of the University of Southern California, Will Ferrell became interested in performing while a student at University High School in Irvine, California, where he made his school&#39;s daily morning announcements over the public address system in disguised voices. He started as a member of the Los Angeles comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975) repertory players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers. It was there he met Chris Kattan and the two became good friends and both went on to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975) later. He has also appeared on several television programs, including &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot; (1999), &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; (1993) and &quot;Living Single&quot; (1993) during his time at The Groundlings.

He was declared quite possibly the worst cast member ever during his first season. However, his talents of impersonations and range of characters shot him forward to making him arguably the greatest &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975) cast member ever. During his seven year run he is one of the few cast members to ever be nominated for an Emmy for a performance and played George W. Bush during the 2000 elections. He&#39;s appeared in every &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975) movie since his premiere on the show in 1995. In 2002 he left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975) and was the only cast member to ever receive a farewell from all the current cast members at the end of the season finale show.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Julia O&#39;Hara Stiles was born on March 28, 1981 in New York City, the outgoing daughter of an elementary school teacher father and a Greenwich Village artist mother, and the eldest of three children. Encouraged to take modern dance lessons at an early age, she was introduced to Shakespeare and theater. At age 11, she made her debut as a child actress with the experimental off-Broadway La MaMa Theatre. Her passion grew and by the next year was performing professionally and working in commercials. A bright, precocious student, she was seriously considered for the child vampire role of Claudia in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) but lost out in the end to Kirsten Dunst. She continued training at New York&#39;s Professional Children&#39;s School and, at 15, made her cinematic bow with I Love You, I Love You Not (1996) with Claire Danes. Next featured as the daughter of Harrison Ford in The Devil&#39;s Own (1997), her breakout role came on TV with the hard-hitting mini-movie Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV), which was produced by Oprah Winfrey and dealt with child abuse. Her wish to play Shakespeare was granted threefold with her participation in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), which was based on the Bard&#39;s &quot;The Taming of The Shrew&quot; and won her the Chicago Film Critics Award as the volatile teen Kat; an updated version of Hamlet (2000) which paired her Ophelia with Ethan Hawke; and another updated version of &quot;Othello&quot; entitled O (2001), which had her high school character of Desi (Desdemona) involved in a mixed romantic relationship with African-American Mekhi Phifer. The violent-edged film was made in 1998 but not released until three years later due to the tragic Colorado student shootings at Columbine High School. In addition, Julia later portrayed Viola off-Broadway in a Shakespeare-in-the-Park production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 2002. </td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>John Moore was born in Dundalk, Ireland in 1970, a small town situated about 60 miles from the country&#39;s capital Dublin. Moore attended a technical college in Dublin where he studied filmmaking and after completing the school he went on to direct and write a series of short films all produced in his native Ireland. These include Jack&#39;s Bicycle (1990) which has been broadcasted on Irish TV channel RTV on occasion. Moore then was hired to make a series of commercials and ended up making the launch advertisement for the Sega Dreamcast, the ad was so bombastic and visually impressive that Twentieth Century Fox ended up offering him the job on Behind Enemy Lines (2001), a $40 million action film centered around the conflict in Bosnia. The film starred Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson. Whilst a modest box-office success the film fared only average with critics who varied in their opinions, and in later years Moore himself admitted that perhaps his approach had been to lightweight and a conflict of that scope required a more deep and thoughtful motion picture. On the set of Behind Enemy Lines (2001) Moore was nearly killed via a Tank in an action sequence and had his life saved in the last moment by a stuntman who dragged him from harm&#39;s way. Moore&#39;s next film was a remake of The Flight of the Phoenix (1965) and shared the same name only dropping the &quot;the&quot; at the titles beginning. Flight of the Phoenix (2004) starred Dennis Quaid and Miranda Otto and told virtually the same story as the original, a group of people stranded in the desert after a plane crash. The picture was a huge box-office flop making just slightly over $21 million worldwide on a considerably larger budget. Critics showed the same unsure reaction to the film as they had on Behind Enemy Lines (2001), lavishing praise on certain aspects but harshly criticizing others. Moore himself was more pleased with the finished article on this occasion but the public&#39;s financial rejection suggests others weren&#39;t. After this Moore was involved with two other films one entitled &quot;The last mission&quot; which collapsed due to script issues and the 2006 smash X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). In the end it was not Moore who directed the third in the X-Men trilogy but Rush Hour 2 (2001) director Brett Ratner. However Moore did manage to get a film into cinemas during Summer 2006 in the end, he remade The Omen (1976) and had it released on the 06/06/06, a gimmick associated with the films satanic plot. The Omen (2006) was a fairly faithful remake and starred Julia Stiles along with Liev Schreiber and David Thewlis. Moore agreed to make the film as he names the 1976 original among his all time favorite movies along with Jaws (1975) and Freaks (1932). The film made a worldwide $120 million from a $25 million budget and thus had to be considered a success in terms of box-office. The critics were once more split, most criticized the picture for following the original too closely but by the same token generally a kind word was spared for Moore&#39;s impressive visuals and the strong cast. This marked the director&#39;s third collaboration with Twentieth Century Fox, a fourth arriving in the form of video-game adaptation Max Payne (2008) in October 2008. </td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Swedish-born Lena Olin already had a successful career as an actress before she came to Hollywood. She acted at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm and was directed by Ingmar Bergman. Her father, Stig Olin, was also an actor and played in six of Bergman&#39;s films. Lena also belongs to the Bergman &quot;family&quot;. As a young actress, she played in the great classics of William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg. She made her international debut as a movie actress in After the Rehearsal (1984) (TV) (aka &quot;After the Rehearsal&quot;), directed by Bergman. In western Europe, she became well-known in the political movie The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) as &quot;Sabina&quot;, in a story about the Prague spring (1968). After coming to the US, she played mostly distinguished, exotic temptresses, intelligent women and crude vamps. Bergman had developed Lena&#39;s artistic gift to play different human emotions and express them in a subtle way. Sydney Pollack, director of Out of Africa (1985), rewrote the screenplay for Havana (1990/I) especially for her. This explains why this film recalls associations with the classic Casablanca (1942), starring Ingrid Bergman, also from Sweden. Olin received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Enemies: A Love Story (1989). She went on to have a choice role in Chocolat (2000), which received a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. She made a move to the smaller screen and played the role for one season as the deliciously evil &quot;Irina Derevko&quot;, the mother to Jennifer Garner&#39;s &quot;Sydney Bristow&quot; in the series &quot;Alias&quot; (2001). Olin received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>August 18, 1933</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>Roman Polanski is a Polish film director, producer, writer and actor. Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA he is considered one of the few &quot;truly international filmmakers. Roman Polanski&#39;s parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began: on Germany&#39;s invasion in 1939 as a Jewish family they were all sent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent to two different concentration camps, his father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria where he survived the war and his mother to Auschwitz where she was murdered. He witnessed his father&#39;s capture and then, at 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war at first wandering through the Polish countryside pretending to be a Roman-Catholic visiting his relatives. Although this saved his life he was severely mistreated suffering a near fatal beating which left him with a fractured skull. Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed little concerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed Poland became increasingly war torn and he lived life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find. Still under 12 years old he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war&#39;s end in 1945, he was reunited with his father who sent him to technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen another career. In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda&#39;s A Generation (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School. His early shorts such as Two Men and a Wardrobe (1958), The Fat and the Lean (1961), and Mammals (1962) showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships. His feature debut, Knife in the Water (1962), was the first Polish post-war film not associated with the war theme. Though already a major Polish filmmaker Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France. While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, G√©rard Brach, who eventually became his long-time collaborator. The next two films, Repulsion (1965) and Cul-de-sac (1966), made in England and co-written by Brach, won Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin Film Festivals. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller Rosemary&#39;s Baby (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife Sharon Tate by the infamous Manson gang in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release: Chinatown (1974). It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the statutory rape of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from the USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his work became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results as in A Pure Formality (1994). By: Yuri German (blsidt1 AT imf.org) and edited by Steve Somers</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>His early film career was fueled by almost unbelievable good luck, but it&#39;s his talent and originality that have kept him at the top of the Hollywood tree. Tim Burton began drawing at an early age, going on to attend the California Institute of the Arts, studying animation after being awarded a fellowship from Disney, for whom he went on to work. Although he found that the mainstream Disney films he worked on (The Fox and the Hound (1981)) were far removed from his own sensibility, Disney let him have the freedom to work on his own personal projects, the six-minute animated black-and-white Gothic Vincent Price tribute Vincent (1982), and the 27-minute live-action Frankenweenie (1984), which was judged unsuitable for children and never released. However, Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) saw it and decided that Burton, still only in his mid-twenties, would be the ideal person to direct his feature debut, Pee-wee&#39;s Big Adventure (1985). An enormous (and surprise) box-office hit, it led to the supernatural comedy Beetlejuice (1988), which in turn led to Burton being entrusted with the reins on the hugely expensive Batman (1989). Although his least personal film, it was one of the most successful films of all time, and gave him unprecedented power in Hollywood considering the originality and adventurousness of his work thus far. Edward Scissorhands (1990), another hit, saw him at the peak of his creative powers and established a fruitful working relationship with actor Johnny Depp. Batman Returns (1992) was a far darker and quirkier film than the original, a reflection of how much creative freedom Burton had won (though Warner Bros were reputedly unhappy with the final result). And although Ed Wood (1994), his loving tribute to the life and work of the legendary Worst Director of All Time, Edward D. Wood Jr., was a box-office disaster, it garnered some of the best reviews of Burton&#39;s career, and suggests that he&#39;ll continue dazzling audiences for many years to come.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>October 28, 1974</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>Born in Puerto Rico to Children of God missionaries &quot;John Bottom Amram&quot; and &quot;Arlyn Dunetz Jochebed&quot; (a.k.a. Heart), Joaquin was the middle child in a brood of five. As a youngster, he took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe. The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname &quot;Phoenix&quot; to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Heart found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into TV work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin&#39;s first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River&#39;s sitcom, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1982). He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special, &quot;ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (#12.6)&quot; (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp, SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama, Russkies (1987). In the late &#39;80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River&#39;s film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn&#39;t sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Parenthood (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while - he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world. His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (an L.A. nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 9-11, which was rebroadcast on radio and TV the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman&#39;s obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics&#39; darling in his own right. His follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to future fianc√©e Liv Tyler (the pair dated for almost three years). He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone&#39;s U Turn (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Return to Paradise (1998). He and &quot;Paradise&quot; co-star, Vince Vaughn, re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper, Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8MM (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as a selfish, paranoid young emperor opposite Russell Crowe&#39;s swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (1999) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade&#39;s asylum in Quills (2000).</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Ridley Scott was born in South Shields, Tyne and Wear (then Northumberland) on 30 November 1937. His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the UK and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. He joined BBC in 1962 as trainee set designer working on several high profile shows. He attended a trainee director&#39;s course while he was there and his first directing job was an episode of the prestigious BBC series &quot;Z Cars&quot; (1962), &quot;Z Cars: Error of Judgement (#4.40)&quot; (1965). The success of Star Wars (1977) inspired Scott&#39;s return to sci-fi (he had been a production designer on the cult series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1963) while he was at the BBC) and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O&#39;Bannon&#39;s low budget sci-fi horror movie Alien (1979), a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>By transforming into his characters and pulling the audience in, Ed Harris has earned the reputation as one of the most talented actors of our time. Born in Tenafly, New Jersey, Harris grew up as the middle child. After graduating high school, he attended New York&#39;s Columbia University, where he played football. After viewing local theater productions, Harris took a sudden interest in acting. He left Columbia, headed to Oklahoma, where his parents were living, and enrolled in the University of Oklahoma&#39;s theater department. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to find work. He started acting in theater and television guest spots. Harris landed his first leading role in a film in cult-favorite George A. Romero&#39;s Knightriders (1981). Two years later, he got his first taste of critical acclaim, playing astronaut John Glenn in The Right Stuff (1983). Also that year, he made his New York stage debut in Sam Shepard&#39;s &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, a performance that earned him an Obie for Outstanding Actor. Harris&#39; career gathered momentum after that. In 2000, he made his debut as a director in the Oscar-winning film Pollock (2000).</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Ron Howard</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>director</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>March 1, 1954</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>-</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>Ron was born in Oklahoma, into an acting family - his father had realized a boyhood dream of acting by attending the University of Oklahoma and majoring in drama, and his mother went through acting school in New York. He was in his first movie at 18 months, Frontier Woman (1956), although his first real part was at the age of 4. Soon a regular on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1956), he was cast as Opie on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960), and later moved from a child in Mayberry to America&#39;s teenager as Richie Cunningham in &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974). The life of a child star is certainly not routine, but Ron&#39;s parents wanted his life to be as normal as possible - he attended public schools and at age 15 even took nine months off to play a basketball season. The transition from child actor to adult actor is always difficult, but for Ron the real transition was from child actor to adult director. There were some film roles, such as The Shootist (1976) for which he received a Golden Globe nomination, but his dream and now his focus was directing. He had begun shooting films at age 15 with a Super-8 camera, and after high school spent two years in a film program at the University of Southern California, but then left, feeling he could learn more from actual experience. That first film was the hardest to finance, but he struck a deal with Roger Corman - he would star in Eat My Dust (1976) and Corman would produce Grand Theft Auto (1977) which Howard would direct (he also wrote the script and starred). It was a success, and his directorial career was jump-started. Married since 1975 to his high school sweetheart, he, in 1997, is enjoying a life of telling stories as one of Hollywood&#39;s top directors.</td>
